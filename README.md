NG0302: The pipe 'keyvalue' could not be found in the '_AppComponent' component. Verify that it is included in the '@Component.imports' of this component. Find more at https://angular.io/errors/NG0302






NG0303: Can't bind to 'ngForOf' since it isn't a known property of 'h3' (used in the '_AppComponent' component template).
1. If 'h3' is an Angular component and it has the 'ngForOf' input, then verify that it is included in the '@Component.imports' of this component.
2. To allow any property add 'NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA' to the '@Component.schemas' of this component.
